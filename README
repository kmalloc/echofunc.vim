Usage:
              When you type '(' after a function name
              in insert mode, the function declaration
              will be displayed in the command line
              automatically. Then you may use Alt+- and
              Alt+= (configurable via EchoFuncKeyPrev
              and EchoFuncKeyNext) to cycle between
              function declarations (if exists).

              Another feature is to provide a balloon tip
              when the mouse cursor hovers a function name,
              macro name, etc. This works with when
              +balloon_eval is compiled in.

Options:
              g:EchoFuncLangsDict
                Dictionary to map the Vim file types to
                tags languages that should be used. You do
                not need to touch it in most cases.
              g:EchoFuncLangsUsed
                File types to enable echofunc, in case you
                do not want to use EchoFunc on all file
                types supported. Example:
                  let g:EchoFuncLangsUsed = ["java","cpp"]
              g:EchoFuncMaxBalloonDeclarations
                Maximum lines to display in balloon declarations.
              g:EchoFuncKeyNext
                Key to echo the next function
              g:EchoFuncKeyPrev
                Key to echo the previous function
